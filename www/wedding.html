		On May 30th, 2010, my wonderful wife, Sarah, and I were married at her
		family's ranch in Westlake Village, CA, just outside of Los Angeles. It
		was a beautiful, sunny, Southern Californian day, and an even more
		beautiful occasion. The ceremony was a traditional Jewish wedding,
		preceded by a speeches by both the bride and groom to their respective
		wedding parties. The ceremony was followed my an evening of dancing and
		singing and eating under the setting Californian sun.
	</div>

		A day after the wedding, Sarah and I took off on a honeymoon to Italy,
		where we visited Venice, Florence, Tuscany, Umbria, the Amalfi Coast,
		and Rome. We had an amazing time. If you would like to see some photos
		from the honey, please look
