		This is a small collection of software that I have written to help me in
		tasks I regularly do. Generally speaking, I release my software under
		<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL v3</a>, but do check
		the headers in the software to confirm this.

	<h3><a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> scripts</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="downloads/git-clone-branches">git-clone-branches</a> is a
			shell script for cloning only a specific set of branches from a
			repository. In reality, it is really a wrapper around a "git init"
			followed by "git remote add", but I find it handy whenever I want to
			get only a specific branch or two from a repository.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="downloads/git-empty-branch">git-empty-branch</a> is a shell
			script for creating a branch in a repostory with no history. This
			branch effectively has the state of the first, uncommitted branch
			after a call to "git init". This is convenient if you want to start
			a branch that has independent history from your other branches. For
			example, after creating a bunch of coding branches, if you want to
			start a separate, fresh branch for documentation, but you do not
			want a separate repository, this might be handy.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>utilities for experiments</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="downloads/delay-traffic">delay-traffic</a> is a shell
			script for adding delay to network traffic on your Linux machine.
			This is useful in experiments where network delay matters but you
			want to normalize the delay across your experiments. This is most
			useful when you are doing local network access, otherwise general
			network delay will be added in addition to the artificial latency,
			thus defeating the normalization this provides.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>javascript utilities</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="downloads/jslint-rhino-wrap.js">jslint-rhino-wrap.js</a> is
			a script for running the wonderful JavaScript code quality tool
			<a href="http://www.jslint.com/lint.html">JSLint</a> on local files
			on the command line. This script is built to run under the solid
			<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a>
			<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> platform, so make
			sure to install that first before trying to use this script. The
			script also requires a local copy of JSLint. You can find the latest
			and greatest
			<a href="https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/master/jslint.js">
			here</a>. You run the script script by uttering the following at the
			command line: <span class="code">rhino jslint_rhino_wrap.js
			jslint.js [options]... [files]...</span> You may find it useful to
			write a script to specify a permanent path to your
			<span class="code">jslint.js</span> file.
			Further options are specified in the comments at the top of th
			script.
