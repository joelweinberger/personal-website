				Abstract State Machines (ASMs) offer a formalism for describing
				state transitions over relational structures. This makes them
				promising for modeling system features such as access control,
				especially in an environment where the policy's outcome depends on
				the evolving state of the system. The current notions of modularity
				for ASMs, however, provide insufficiently strong guarantees of
				consistency in the face of parallel update requests. We present a
				real-world context that illustrates this problem, discuss desirable
				properties for composition in this context, describe an operator
				that exhibits these properties, formalize its meaning, and outline
				its implementation strategy.
