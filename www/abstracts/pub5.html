		A Systematic Analysis of XSS Sanitization in Web Application Frameworks
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
		While most research on XSS defense has focused on techniques for
		securing existing applications and re-architecting browser mechanisms,
		sanitization remains the industry-standard defense mechanism. By
		streamlining and automating XSS sanitization, web application frameworks
		stand in a good position to stop XSS but have received little research
		attention.  In order to drive research on web frameworks, we
		systematically study the security of the XSS sanitization abstractions
		frameworks provide.  We develop a novel model of the web browser and
		characterize the challenges of XSS sanitization. Based on the model, we
		systematically evaluate the XSS abstractions in 14 major
		commercially-used web frameworks. We find that frameworks often do not
		address critical parts of the XSS conundrum. We perform an empirical
		analysis of 8 large web applications to extract the requirements of
		sanitization primitives from the perspective of real-world applications.
		Our study shows that there is a wide gap between the abstractions
		provided by frameworks and the requirements of applications.
