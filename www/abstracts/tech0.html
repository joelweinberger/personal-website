				We present a model of the security policy for the Web-based
				Continue conference management tool. The policy model and
				properties are written as ASM Relational Transducers,
				which we extend with a module system in order to simplify the
				handling of conflicting updates. We assume prior familiarity
				with the security policy concerns surrounding Continue. First,
				we review the ASM Relational Transducer modeling and property
				language. Then we describe the basic structure of our policy
				implementation and demonstrate the ability to model useful
				properties in the original core ASM language. We exploring the
				use of the unmodified modeling language in a security policy
				context and describe typical ASM Relational Transducer
				complexity concerns and how these minimally impact our
				implementation. Next, we discuss difficulties encountered in
				representing our policy and properties in the standard ASM
				language, including our implementation in the appendices.
				Following the description of adapting ASMs for use in security
				modeling, we introduce policy modules and a composition operator
				to overcome the difficulty of programming in the original
				language known as the consistent update problem. Finally, we
				describe a reduction from our extended language to the original
				language, and prove it satisfies our required correctness
				property.
