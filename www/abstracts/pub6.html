		Verifying Higher-order Programs with the Dijkstra Monad
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
		<p>
		Modern programming languages, ranging from Haskell and ML, to
		JavaScript, C# and Java, all make extensive use of higher-order state. This
		paper advocates a new verification methodology for higher-order stateful
		programs, based on a new monad of predicate transformers called the Dijkstra
		monad.  Using the Dijkstra monad has a number of benefits. First, the monad
		naturally yields a weakest pre-condition calculus. Second, the computed
		specifications are structurally simpler in several ways, e.g., single-state
		post-conditions are sufficient (rather than the more complex two-state
		post-conditions). Finally, the monad can easily be varied to handle features
		like exceptions and heap invariants, while retaining the same type inference
		algorithm.  We implement the Dijkstra monad and its type inference algorithm
		for the F* programming language. Our most extensive case study evaluates the
		Dijkstra monad and its F* implementation by using it to verify JavaScript
		programs.  Specifically, we describe a tool chain that translates programs in a
		subset of JavaScript decorated with assertions and loop invariants to F*. Once
		in F*, our type inference algorithm computes verification conditions and
		automatically discharges their proofs using an SMT solver. We use our tools to
		prove that a core model of the JavaScript runtime in F* respects various
		invariants and that a suite of JavaScript source programs are free of runtime
		errors.
