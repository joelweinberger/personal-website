				We identify a class of Web browser implementation vulnerabilities,
				cross-origin JavaScript capability leaks, which occur when
				the browser leaks a JavaScript pointer from one security origin to
				another. We devise an algorithm for detecting these vulnerabilities
				by monitoring the &quot;points-to&quot; relation of the JavaScript
				heap.  Our algorithm finds a number of new vulnerabilities in the
				open-source WebKit browser engine used by Safari.  We propose an
				approach to mitigate this class of vulnerabilities by adding access
				control checks to browser JavaScript engines.  These access control
				checks are backwards-compatible because they do not alter semantics
				of the Web platform.  Through an application of the inline cache,
				we implement these checks with an overhead of 1&ndash;2% on
				industry-standard benchmarks.
