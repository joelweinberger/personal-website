		Thesis: Analysis and Enforcement of Web Application Security Policies
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
		<p>
		Web applications are generally more exposed to untrusted user content
		than traditional applications. Thus, web applications face a variety of
		new and unique threats, especially that of content injection. One method
		for preventing these types of attacks is web application security
		policies. These policies specify the behavior or structure of the web
		application.  The goal of this work is twofold. First, we aim to
		understand how security policies and their systems are currently applied
		to web applications. Second, we aim to advance the mechanisms used to
		apply policies to web applications. We focus on the first part through
		two studies, examining two classes of current web application security
		policies. We focus on the second part by studying and working towards
		two new ways of applying policies.  These areas will advance the state
		of the art in understanding and building web application security
		policies and provide a foundation for future work in securing web
		applications.
