				Publishers wish to sandbox third-party advertisements to protect
				themselves from malicious advertisements. One promising
				approach, used by ADsafe, Dojo Secure, and Jacaranda, sandboxes
				advertisements by statically verifying that their JavaScript
				conforms to a safe subset of the language. These systems
				blacklist known-dangerous properties that would let
				advertisements escape the sandbox. Unfortunately, this approach
				does not prevent advertisements from accessing new methods added
				to the built-in prototype objects by the hosting page. In this
				paper, we design an algorithm to detect these methods and use our
				tool to determine experimentally that one-third of the Alexa US
				top 100 web sites would be exploitable by an ADsafe-verified
				advertisement. We propose an improved statically verified
				JavaScript subset that whitelists known-safe properties using
				namespaces. Our approach maintains the expressiveness and
				performance of static verification while improving security.
