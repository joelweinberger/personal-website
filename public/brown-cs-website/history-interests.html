                I guess not surprisingly, as a history concentrator, I have a variety
                of interests in history. While I've certainly taken my fair share of
                history <A href="courses.html">courses</A>, certain subjects strike
                me more than others.

                I've been interested in Post-Renaissance and Reformation Europe
                for quite some time now. Ironically, however, I haven't taken a
                course on the subject at Brown. I'm always on the lookout for a
                new book to read on the subject.

                I used to think that American History, for the most part, was a
                rather dull area of study. I've recently come to drastically change
                my mind about that as some of the best books I've read recently have
                been in the context of American History. Just about anything by
                <A href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/History/faculty/gwood.html">
                Gordon Wood</A> is guaranteed to be excellent. I'm convinced that my
                interest in American History arises purely out of interest in the
                individuals that formed the nation. For what I consider the best example
                of this, read <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400077303/sr=8-1/qid=1141671492/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-2228996-3937704?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Titan</A>, by Ron
                Chernow, the biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. The exception to
                this rule, in my opinion, is America's race relations and struggles.
                There are some really fantastic books on the subject, and for a good
                start, try Glenn Loury's <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674006259/qid=1141671646/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-2228996-3937704?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">
                The Anatomy of Racial Inequality</A>.
