		Towards Client-side HTML Security Policies
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
		<p>
		With the proliferation of content rich web applications, content
		injection has become an increasing problem. Cross site scripting is the
		most prominent example of this.  Many systems have been designed to
		mitigate content injection and cross site scripting. Notable examples
		are BEEP, BLUEPRINT, and Content Security Policy, which can be grouped
		as HTML security policies.  We evaluate these systems, including the
		first empirical evaluation of Content Security Policy on real
		applications. We propose that HTML security policies should be the
		defense of choice in web applications going forward. We argue, however,
		that current systems are insufficient for the needs of web applications,
		and research needs to be done to determine the set of properties an HTML
		security policy system should have. We propose several ideas for
		research going forward in this area.
