		Monadic Refinement Types for Verifying JavaScript Programs
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
		<p>
		Researchers have developed several special-purpose type systems and
		program logics to analyze JavaScript and other dynamically typed
		programming languages.  Still, no prior system can precisely reason
		about both higher-order programs and mutable state; each system comes
		with its own delicate soundness proof (when such proofs are provided at
		all); and tools based on these theories (when they exist) are a
		significant implementation burden.
		</p>
		<p>
		This paper shows that JavaScript programs can be verified using a
		general-purpose verification tool---in our case, F*, a dependently typed
		dialect of ML. Our methodology consists of a few steps. First, we extend
		prior work on LambdaJS (Guha et al.) by translating JavaScript programs
		to F*. Within F*, we type pure JavaScript terms using a refinement of
		the type dyn, an algebraic datatype for dynamically typed values, where
		the refinement recovers more precise type information. Stateful
		expressions are typed using the Hoare state monad. Relying on a
		general-purpose weakest pre-condition calculus for this monad, we obtain
		higher-order verification conditions for JavaScript programs that can be
		discharged (via a novel encoding) by an off-the-shelf automated theorem
		prover. Our approach enjoys a fully mechanized proof of soundness, by
		virtue of the soundness of F*.
		</p>
		<p>
		We report on experiments that apply our tool chain to verify a
		collection of web browser extensions for the absence of JavaScript
		runtime errors. We conclude that, despite commonly held misgivings about
		JavaScript, automated verification for a sizable subset of the language
		is feasible. Our work opens the door to applying a wealth of research in
		automated program verification techniques to JavaScript programs.
