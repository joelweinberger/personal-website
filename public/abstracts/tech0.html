		ASM Relational Transducer Security Policies
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
			<p>
			We present a model of the security policy for the Web-based
			Continue conference management tool. The policy model and
			properties are written as ASM Relational Transducers,
			which we extend with a module system in order to simplify the
			handling of conflicting updates. We assume prior familiarity
			with the security policy concerns surrounding Continue. First,
			we review the ASM Relational Transducer modeling and property
			language. Then we describe the basic structure of our policy
			implementation and demonstrate the ability to model useful
			properties in the original core ASM language. We exploring the
			use of the unmodified modeling language in a security policy
			context and describe typical ASM Relational Transducer
			complexity concerns and how these minimally impact our
			implementation. Next, we discuss difficulties encountered in
			representing our policy and properties in the standard ASM
			language, including our implementation in the appendices.
			Following the description of adapting ASMs for use in security
			modeling, we introduce policy modules and a composition operator
			to overcome the difficulty of programming in the original
			language known as the consistent update problem. Finally, we
			describe a reduction from our extended language to the original
			language, and prove it satisfies our required correctness
			property.
