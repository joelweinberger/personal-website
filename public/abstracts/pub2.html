		Preventing Capability Leaks in Secure JavaScript Subsets
	</h3>

	<div><div id="abstract">
			<p>
			Publishers wish to sandbox third-party advertisements to protect
			themselves from malicious advertisements. One promising
			approach, used by ADsafe, Dojo Secure, and Jacaranda, sandboxes
			advertisements by statically verifying that their JavaScript
			conforms to a safe subset of the language. These systems
			blacklist known-dangerous properties that would let
			advertisements escape the sandbox. Unfortunately, this approach
			does not prevent advertisements from accessing new methods added
			to the built-in prototype objects by the hosting page. In this
			paper, we design an algorithm to detect these methods and use our
			tool to determine experimentally that one-third of the Alexa US
			top 100 web sites would be exploitable by an ADsafe-verified
			advertisement. We propose an improved statically verified
			JavaScript subset that whitelists known-safe properties using
			namespaces. Our approach maintains the expressiveness and
			performance of static verification while improving security.
